# C & NASM
This project is a website with some tutorials on C &amp; x86 Assembly. The full page can be found on [C & NASM](https://srv2.mysnet.me).
The single sites and the content may be found under the directory [pages](./pages/). Feel free to suggest any improvements.

Note: The changes commited here will be synched with the website later, but due to caching, it might take some time.
