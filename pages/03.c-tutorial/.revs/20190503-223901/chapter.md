! WARNING: This C Tutorial is not written for total beginners, so if you don't know how to program in C-like languages such as Java at least, I advise you to go through other tutorials.

!! CAUTION: This tutorial is a work in progress, meaning it is incomplete at this stage. Feel free to contribute in the comments.

This section shows a tutorial on programming in C using the C99 standard.

**CAUTION:**

All examples here are written using an x86_64 Linux machine (Debian 8), GCC (v 4.9) as C-compiler. Different environments might work differently.

Also note that the tutorial pages have been written by myself. Even though I have tested the functionality of the code before publishing here, I cannot guarantee anything, especially not the efficiency of the resulting programs as I am not an advanced programmer in C myself and parsed those tutorials to keep a track of stuff as a reminder in my own learning process.

This section is mainly parsed of own examples or some taken and / or edited from [The PC Assembly Language](http://pacman128.github.io/static/pcasm-book.pdf), [C von A bis Z](http://openbook.rheinwerk-verlag.de/c_von_a_bis_z/) and [C von Kopf bis Fu√ü](http://proquest.tech.safaribooksonline.de/book/programming/c/9783955610227). Please refer to the Notice and Resources sections for more information as well as additional sources the following tutorials might be based on.
