This page contains some libraries, a very basic example code to make things run and some other resources that might be helpful.
Get tho the [tutorial](../tutorial) page to learn more on the use and coding.


[nop.asm](nop.asm):
An ASM code with no real operation.

[driver.c](driver.c):
The C driver to link the ASM code with.

[cdecl.h](cdecl.h):
Defines macros to specify the standard C calling convention for ASM "functions" (gobal labels to be precise)

[asm_io.inc](asm_io.inc):
Defines Basic Input/Output functions for ASM (use in 32-bit mode only)

[asm_io.asm](asm_io.asm):
The same functions are defined in here as well. This must be compiled in 32-bit mode and linked with the program if the `asm_io.inc` library was included.

[asm64_io.inc](asm64_io.inc):
Same as `asm_io.inc` but for 64-bit codes.

[asm64_io.asm](asm64_io.asm.):
Same as `asm_io.asm`, but for 64-bit programs.

[nasm-asm_io-overview.pdf](nasm-asm_io-overview.pdf):
A PDF file containing some information on `asm_io` and how to run ASM on Windows, while all of my own examples will be for Linux only. (src: [C. Maedow, University of Maine](http://aturing.umcs.maine.edu/~meadow/courses/cos335/))

[Assembling Script](../asm-script):
source code of a shell script I have prepared for simple ASM tasks that I am using frequntly. It can convert Object files or a C-code into an ASM in NASM syntax and compile to an Object file using NASM.

[Objconv](https://www.agner.org/optimize/#objconv):
Object File Converter is a converter from Object files to ASM in various syntax for both x86 and x64.

[x86_64 registers](x86_64-architecture.html):
A table of all x64 CPU registers and additional information on both x86 and x64 registers. Note: rxx are the x64 registers, while exx are the x86 register names. (src: [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com))

[Linux System Call Codes](linux-system-call-table.html):
A table of Linux x86 system calls and how to use them. We will use `sys_write` in the examples mainly. Caution: this page was written in the GAS syntax, such as register names are preceded by a '%' for instance. (src: [Prof. Dr.-Ing. A. Beck, HTW Dresden](https://www.informatik.htw-dresden.de/~beck/ASM/asm.html))

[PC Assembly Language](http://pacman128.github.io/static/pcasm-book.pdf):
A book written by Dr. Paul Carter to introduce into Intel 8080 and 80386 assembling as he taught Computer Science at the [University of Central Oklahoma](http://www.ucok.edu).

[IntelÂ® 64 and IA-32 Architectures
Optimization Reference Manual](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-optimization-manual.pdf):
Intel's Reference Manual for IA-32 and x64 Optimization. The PDF contains some information on how to optimize your assembly code and includes notes on the efficiecy of some instructions and showing alternatives.

If you want to assemble codes not only to learn ASM, but also to have simplicity in mind, consider using the NASMX libraries:
* [NASMX libraries](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nasmx/),
* [NASMX Docs](https://github.com/thlorenz/nasmx)

!!! NOTE: easier code gives greater maintainability. Especially if you use a code part in multiple places, consider using libraries.
