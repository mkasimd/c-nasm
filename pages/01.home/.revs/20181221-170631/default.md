# C & NASM
## Examples on C-linked ASM

This part of the site contains examples on Assembly programming language using the intel syntax. All ASM examples are written with the [Netwide Assembler (NASM)](https://nasm.us/) and all C codes are written in the C99 syntax.

The pages will contain some examples, but also some basic libraries, such as an IO library for ASM.
