## Legal and Privacy Notes
This website is owned and created by M. Kasim Doenmez.
There are cookies used throughout the site, but those cookies are not used for any tracking means, nor are any information shared with any third parties by us with an exception of [Cloudflare, Inc.](https://www.cloudflare.com) and [Disqus](https://disqus.com). These cookies are solely functional cookies which are required for the elements on the site to function properly. You may delete them in your browser or prohibit saving of cookies by your browser if you do not agree on our cookie policy, while we cannot guarantee a fluent functionality if you do so.

This site may use Cloudflare's CDN network and DNS servers to offer you with better accessability of our services. So you may be connected to both our and Cloudflare's servers and your data such as your IP address as well as your session ID may be received by both and may be stored to offer a fluent service. If you do not consent on using Cloudflare as an intermediate between you and our server, you may add a host or DNS entry to forward any requests on this domain to this server's IP address directly. If you see the TLS certificate to be issued by Let's Encrypt specifically for this domain, it means you are connected to our server without Cloudflare's CDN.

Additionally, this site uses Disqus for you to comment on the tutorials according to the below Commenting Policy. We decided to use Disqus instead of having to manage users and comments by ourselves due to maintainability and accessability reasons, especially as many of you will probably have a Disqus account ready or it can be created easily. The comment functionality is added via scripts and the particular comment section won't have any effect on the site's content, so feel free to block Disqus, if you are concerned by that.


## Commenting Policy ## {#comments}
This site uses Disqus for you to comment on the tutorials, view responses, discuss or give suggestions for us to edit or add something on the specific topic. If you have a specific question, we encourage you to ask on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) instead of commenting the tutorial page as more people will be able to access the question/aswer and you will most likely receive a good response quicker than here. Furthermore, please stay on the topic, especially no adult or abusive content or plain advertising entries (unless useful within the given context) will be tolerated. Some comments may be marked for an audit prior being published. Those will be revised manually by a moderator first, thus it may take some time. Comments and commentators may be audited by any of our moderators at any time and be removed or banned if the moderator is of the opinion that the above said rules are violated.

This site may include several external links. External links will be marked with an arrow after the link and look like [this example](http://example.org).

Furthermore, even though most of the codes provided by this site were tested, the functionality as well as correctnes of those cannot be guaranteed either, such that you may use them at your own risk.

Currently, we are experimenting with a geoDNS implementation and a cached CDN using our servers in Miami (FL, USA), Buffalo (NY, USA), Meppel (NL) and Frankfurt (DE). In future, we might completely turn off Cloudflare's services and switch over to our own DNS and CDN infrastructure with a better accessability in Europe and North America. Our obeservations have marked that even connecting directly to our server in Buffalo is faster than using Cloudflare's CDN network for european visitors. In the process of switching over, some short outage could occur, even though it should not be a concern. Feel free to contact us if you are interested in the topic.
