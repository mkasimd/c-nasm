title: 'Hello World Again'
---

Yes, this is yet another Hello World programm, but don't worry it's the last one! The reason behind making so many different pages showing different ways solving the same problem is to show you that there are multiple ways to solve one problem and that things may vary from platform to platform.

As we have learned using libraries, this last Hello World programm uses `asm_io` for reading and writing instead of System Calls. This way you don't need to remember the ABI for each OS you write the program for.

! COMING SOON! (I was interruoted while typing, so saved what I got right now)

## ASM Code
```nasm
%include "asm_io.inc"

segment .text



```
